The folders contain Codes to create the Plots in the Thesis and assist the computations done in the thesis. The folders are relevant for the following:

HPLOTS: 
python-file to plot:
-Figure 1.1
-Figure 2.1
-Figure 6.1

STABLEEXAMPLE:
python-file to plot:
-Figure 5.1
-Figure 5.2
-Figure 5.3
Mathematica Notebook to show that the stable example is in fact stable

BACKGROUND EQUATIONS:
Mathematica Notebook to derive the background equations for A0, \rho_M, p_M

PERTURBATIONS:
Contains three folders with Notebooks to compute the expansion of the action in scalar, vecotr and tensor modes
