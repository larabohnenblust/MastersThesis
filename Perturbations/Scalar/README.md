ScalarPerturbationsGP:
Shows the expansion of the generalized Proca action in scalar modes, when E = 0. The action in flat gauge and uniform vector gauge can be read of the result. This is needed for SECTION 4.4.3, 4.4.4 and APPENDIX B.

ScalarPerturbationsSchutzSorkin:
Does the expansion of sqrt(-det(g)) and n in scalar modes in gauge-ready form. Is needed for second order action of the Schutz Sorking action as in SECTION 4.3.4.

SolutioninFlatGauge:
Integrates out the non-dynamical degrees of freedom and computes the small-scale action in flat gauge. This is done in APPENDIX B.1.

SolutioninUniformGauge:
Integrates out the non-dynamical degrees of freedom and computes the small-scale action in uniform vector gauge. This is done in APPENDIX B.2.
