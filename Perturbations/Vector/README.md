VectorPerturbationsProca:
Shows the expansion of the generalized Proca action in vector modes. It integrates out the dynamical degree of freedom. This is done for SECTION 4.4.2 and APPENDIX A.

VectorPerturbationsSchutzSorkin:
Shows how to expand sqrt(-det(g)) and n in vector modes. That is necessary to do the expansion of the Schutz Sorkin action in SECTION 4.3.3.
