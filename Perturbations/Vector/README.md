VectorPerturbationsProca:
Shows the expansion of the generalized Proca action in vector modes. It integrates out the dynamical degree of freedom.

VectorPerturbationsSchutzSorkin:
Shows how to expand sqrt(-det(g)) and n in vector modes. That is necessary to do the expansion of the Schutz Sorkin action.
